You continue to make your sandwich while trying to find some logic to an illogical situation. The phone was broken for a couple of weeks now; an incident that was the result of frustration, on your part. After being the recipient of 10 prank calls one night,  frustrated with the bombardment of prank-calls, you slam the phone; accidentally damaging the device. Since then, the phone hasn't been able to ring. 

The ringing continued as well as the distortion of the rings, you turn your head towards Lucky, who is sound asleep and unaffected by the annoying sound. 
Making your way around the counter,  you answer the phone.
"Hello", no reply. 
You answer again, "Hello."

Turning once more towards the den, you realize Lucky wasn't there. You turn your head around to see if the dog might've awoken and walked to his water bowl, which was on the floor beside the counter. Nothing, Lucky wasn't there either. "Dog must've wandered upstairs", you thought.

Realizing you were still on the phone, you reply once more, "Hello,"
no reply, annoyed, you hang up the phone. 
As you make your way back to the counter, you see something in your peripheral.
