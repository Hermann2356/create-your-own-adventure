Looking into the den, you see Lucky has appeared and is standing on all fours with his back turned and is looking straight ahead at the back porch. You move your gaze from the dog and try to distinguish what the animal was so intently looking at, but the most you can make out is the reflection of the tv, reflecting from the clear glass door; which led to the back porch. 

"Lucky, come here boy", no reply or movement from the dog. You utter the command again but still the same result. You move closer to Lucky to make a better sense of what was wrong with the dog. As you approach step by step the dog begins to whimper, not making any movements the dog just continues with it's whimpering. "Strange", you thought, with every step the dog's whimpering got louder and more intense. Walking closer and eventually arriving only inches from the animal, the whimpering had gotten so louder and more intense that you could barely hear the dialogue from the tv.

"Lucky!!", you yell, the dog turns to you; finally acknowledging your call. In horror, you gasp, too horrified to even scream. The image is haunting,  Lucky's eyes were gone; not gone but had lost all signs of any pigmentation in color. The dog's eyes had once been light brown, being diagnosed with cataracts a few years prior had left Lucky blind in his left eye; leaving the dog's left eye gray and filmy. But in horror, it was neither brown nor gray, it was completely black, dark, endless like the voids of space.
