As the phone continue to make the strange distorted sound, you  move your way around the counter and approach the phone. Stretching your hand, you pick up the phone and place the headset toward your left ear and answer "Hello", no reply, "Helloooo", nothing. At this point a sensation of fear take over youself, thinking to yourself, you have seen way too many horror movie moments, where the phone rings and there is no answer. Then boom!, you are being stabbed to death by homicidal maniac from behind, who was lurking in the shadow waiting for his chance to act on his sadistic need to kill. 

You look back to clarify the truth to any predictable horror plot , but their was no one. "Phew!, thank god", the scene behind you didn't change, everything was where it was last, before answering the phone. Lucky was still sound asleep on the chair and the half made sandwich was still on the counter, relieved, you place the phone back on the hook. Walking back to counter you resume constructing the pbj, a few moment pass and you hear a slight whimper to right of you from the den.
