Looking into the den, you see Lucky has awoken and is standing on all fours with has his back turn, looking straight ahead at the back porch. You look up from the dog and try to distinguish what the dog is looking at, but the most you can make out is reflection of the tv, as the tv light hit the clear glass door; that allows both entry and exit to back porch. 

"Lucky, come here boy", no reply or movement from the dog. You utter the command again but still the same result. You move closer to Lucky to make better sense of the what was wrong with the dog. As you approach step by step the dog begins to whimper, not making any movements the dog just continues with it's whimpering. This is strange, you thought, with every step the dog's whimpering got louder and more instense. Walking to about only inches from the animal, afraid and confuse, the whimpering had gotten so loud and instense that you could barely hear the dialouge from the tv.

"Lucky!!", the dog turns around and looks at you, In horror you "gasp", too horrified to even scream. Lucky's eyes were gone; not gone but they had lost all signs of any pigmentation in color. The dog had light brown eyes, a few years back Lucky was diagnose with cataracts and had lost vision in his left eye; leaving the dog with one eye gray and filmy. But to your horror, it was neither brown nor gray, it was complete black, dark, endless like the voids of space.
