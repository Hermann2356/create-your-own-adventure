It is a Friday night and your parents have left for the weekend to visit Aunt Sheryl; she has fallen terribly ill. Rather than bring you along, and run the cost of paying for a dog sitter, they have decided that you will be left alone at home to watch Lucky until they return, Monday morning. Lucky is an old golden retriever, about 13 years of age, and blind in one eye. Lucky was once an energetic, blissful creature but is now just a shadow of his former self. Slow and sluggish, Lucky would need minimum attentiveness, "just gotta feed and walk the dog, piece of cake", you thought.

It was any typical Friday night, reruns of Modern Family were playing on the 40' Samsung tv in the downstairs den. In the den, Lucky was sound asleep on the love seat that faced the sliding door leading to the back porch. With no porch light on, the porch looked dark and ominous; similar to the dark void of space. 

You are in the kitchen making yourself a PBJ sandwich, which is honestly a recipe in your case no 14-year-old girl could get wrong and a recipe you pride yourself as your signature dish of choice. In the process of making the sandwich the phone rings, ring...ring...ring..., you look up from the sandwich and you stare at the phone hanging from the wall facing the kitchen counter. You hesitate to answer because prior to the ring you had the assumption that the phone was broken; unable to ring. But it wasn't the ring that made you hesitate as much as the sound of the ring, it was distorted like the sound wave was being stretched and pulled.
